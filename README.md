    ## About me

I am a positive-thinking person who possesses two sides of power. On one hand, I am organised, structured and attentive to detail. And on the other, due to my personality, I love to communicate with people and solve problems.

I got my Bachelor's degree from faculty of Engineering at Alazhar university. My department was systems and computers where I have studied oop, jave programming and other important fundmentals that any software engineer needs. 

 I am passionate about software testing career, I am intensively studying techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications created for learning purposes.

I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal â€” to become a mid-level software tester in 2 years.
